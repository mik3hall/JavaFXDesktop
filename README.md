## JavaFXDesktop

Work in progress. I noticed a probably rather minor omission bug in JavaFX on OS/X not having a default About system menu item.

I decided to see in general what java.awt.Desktop could do for JavaFX desktop applications.

Mostly OS/X at this point. I tested Windows and Linux (Ubuntu), on Virtual Box, just to verify what was indicated as supported. 

Clearly the API is supported the most and therefore most important on OS/X.

Most of the coding is probably done but still a lot of fill in the blanks for what is OS/X supported.
